HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer classes don't do very much. May be worth replacing them with a type field in Player class.

Pawn and Model classes have very similar methods which check for en passant
//in pawn class
//these methods check if a particular move is a valid en passant move
private boolean validWhiteEnPassant(Model model, int col, int row) 
private boolean validBlackEnPassant(Model model, int col, int row)

in Model class
//these methods check if en passant has already occurred so that the capturd pawn can be removed
public void checkForEnPassant ( Piece piece, int col1, int row1, int col2, int row2 )
public boolean checkForWhiteEnPassant( Piece piece, Piece previousPiece, int oldX, int oldY, int newX, int newY, int col1, int row1, int col2, int row2 )
public boolean checkForBlackEnPassant( Piece piece, Piece previousPiece, int oldX, int oldY, int newX, int newY, int col1, int row1, int col2, int row2 )
